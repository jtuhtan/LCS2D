# LCS2D
MATLAB code for processing 2D Langrangian Coherent Structures from a stationary velocity vector field

The code includes several scripts for generating, testing and calculating Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS) from a stationary 2D velocity field.

Requirements to run the LCS are:

1) Known x,y Cartesian coordinates.
2) Known u,v velocity vectors at each of the coordinates from 1)

Example data can be generated using the script gyrefield_20130208.m
